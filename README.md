# Dr. Steve Brule's Mood Reader Extravaganza!
### We all know Dr. Steve Brule for his amazing comedy and not so amazing social skills, manners, etc, but did you know that he could read peoples moods just by hearing a few bits of information about them? Yeah, me either, until I created a mood reader app where you insert information into a form, choose what mood you're in from the provided moods, and then press the 'Magical Mood Reading Button' to see if Dr. Brule can guess what mood you may be in!
